- **Self-Awareness:** Students gain a heightened sense of self-awareness through mindfulness exercises, which helps them better understand their emotional states, thoughts, and reactions.
- **Emotional Regulation:** Mindfulness encourages students to observe their emotions without judgment, which helps them respond to situations with greater emotional intelligence and control.

### b. **Incorporating Mindfulness into Fitness Routines**
- **Breathing Exercises:** Mindfulness-based breathing techniques, such as deep belly breathing, box breathing, or diaphragmatic breathing, are integrated into physical fitness routines to help students focus and calm the mind.
