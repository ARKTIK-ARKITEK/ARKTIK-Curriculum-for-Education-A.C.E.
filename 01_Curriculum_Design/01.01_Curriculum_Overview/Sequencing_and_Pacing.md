Each module or project includes a period for evaluation, self-reflection, and feedback, allowing students to assess their progress and set goals for improvement. This reflective approach helps prevent burnout and ensures that learning is internalized.

### c. **Incorporating Variety in Learning Activities**
- Pacing includes a variety of learning activities such as group discussions, independent projects, creative exercises, hands-on experiments, and global engagements. These varied activities maintain engagement, cater to different learning styles, and ensure that students stay motivated throughout their educational journey.

### d. **Individualized Learning Pathways**
- Recognizing that each student has different strengths and interests, the curriculum allows for flexibility in pacing. Students can accelerate their learning in areas of strength and spend more time on subjects that require additional support, ensuring that each student progresses at a pace that is right for them.

## 3. **Intensity Considerations**

The intensity of the curriculum is carefully calibrated to ensure that students are challenged without feeling overwhelmed. By adjusting the workload, project complexity, and pacing, the framework accommodates students' needs at every stage of their academic journey.

### a. **Year 1–3: Light Intensity for Exploration**
- The early years are designed to offer an introduction to core subjects with light intensity. The focus is on engaging students with diverse learning experiences and allowing them to build confidence in their abilities. The curriculum promotes exploration, play, and curiosity, with an emphasis on emotional and social development.

### b. **Year 4–6: Increasing Intensity for Deeper Learning**
- As students develop their academic abilities, the intensity increases. More challenging projects, deeper subject matter, and higher expectations for independent work help prepare students for more rigorous coursework in the later years. Students begin to manage multiple subjects and interdisciplinary projects simultaneously.

### c. **Year 7–9: High Intensity for Mastery**
- The intensity is highest in these years, with students expected to manage multiple projects, take on leadership roles, and engage in complex problem-solving tasks. Students are encouraged to step outside their comfort zones, tackle ambitious challenges, and demonstrate mastery in core subjects and interdisciplinary fields.

### d. **Year 10+: Flexibility for Personal and Professional Growth**
