# Security Policy

## Introduction
At ARKTIK, we take the security of our repositories and digital resources very seriously. This document outlines the security practices and procedures we follow to protect our code, data, and infrastructure. It also includes guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities and incidents.

## Access Control

### User Permissions
- Only authorized users will have access to sensitive repositories.
- Permissions are granted based on roles. Each team member should only have the necessary access to perform their tasks.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** is required for all users with administrative or sensitive access to the repository.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Admin**: Full access to repository settings and management.
- **Maintainer**: Ability to merge and approve pull requests, manage issues, and maintain code quality.
- **Contributor**: Can propose changes through pull requests but cannot merge them.
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to the repository.

## Repository Management

### Privacy Settings
- All repositories containing sensitive information are kept **private**.
- Public repositories are reviewed regularly to ensure they do not contain sensitive data.

### Branch Protection Rules
- **Main/Master Branch**: Protected against direct changes. All changes must go through pull requests and be reviewed before merging.
- **Review Required**: Ensure that code changes are peer-reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.

### Audit Logs
- All administrative actions (e.g., changes to repository settings or user permissions) are logged and reviewed regularly.

## Data and Content Security

### Sensitive Data
- **Never** commit sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or personal data into the repository.
- Use `.gitignore` files to avoid accidental inclusion of sensitive files.

### Encryption
- All sensitive data is stored in encrypted form.
- Communication with GitHub should always use HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.

## Code Review and Audits

### Peer Reviews
- All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged into the main branch.

### Automated Security Scanning
- We use tools like **GitHub Dependabot** and **Snyk** to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities in our dependencies.

### Manual Audits
- We conduct periodic manual code audits to identify potential security issues that automated tools might miss.

## Incident Response

### Incident Detection
- We monitor for unusual activity, such as unauthorized pushes, changes to permissions, or access from suspicious IP addresses.
- Alerts will be set up to notify administrators in the event of a security breach.

### Response Plan
- **Detection**: Identify and assess the scope of the breach.
- **Containment**: Stop the attack or prevent further access to sensitive resources.
- **Recovery**: Restore access and services from secure backups.
- **Post-Incident Review**: Analyze the breach to understand how it happened and update security measures to prevent future occurrences.

## Security Best Practices

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities associated with outdated libraries.
- Use **Dependabot** for automatic dependency updates.

### Apply Security Patches
- Always apply security patches immediately when they are released.

### Signed Commits
- Enable signed commits to ensure that only verified contributors can push changes.

### Security Awareness
- Team members should be trained in basic cybersecurity best practices to recognize phishing and other malicious activities.

## Compliance and Legal

### Licensing
- All code and content within this repository must comply with the open-source license outlined in the `LICENSE` file.
- We ensure that all third-party dependencies are licensed properly and do not violate any legal rights.

### Data Privacy
- Any personal data handled within the repository must comply with privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant laws.
- Personal data should not be stored in the repository unless explicitly necessary and with the proper legal basis.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover any vulnerabilities or security issues, please report them directly to us using the following contact methods:

- **Email**: security@arktikinitiative.org
- **GitHub Issues**: Open a private issue if you prefer to submit a non-sensitive report.

We take all reports seriously and will investigate promptly.

## Conclusion
This security policy helps us maintain the integrity and confidentiality of our repositories and ensures that we follow best practices for secure development. Thank you for helping us keep our code safe!
